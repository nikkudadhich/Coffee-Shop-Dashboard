# Coffee-Shop-Dashboard
Power BI gave an effective platform for transforming raw data into actionable insights. The dashboard enables the coffee shop to monitor revenue, profit, product trends, and store performance. Decisions regarding business such as expansion, marketing, and product optimization can be made with more confidence.

Introduction
The purpose of this project is to examine the sales performance of a chain of coffee shops through Microsoft Power BI. The project illustrates how raw transactional data can be converted into actionable insights through data cleaning, transformation, modeling, and interactive dashboards.
Key points of this project:
•	Interpret sales trends by products, categories, and locations.
•	Evaluate performance through KPIs like Revenue, Profit, and Average Order Value.
•	Choose best-selling products and categories driving revenue.
•	Evaluate store locations to emphasize top performers and low-performing stores.
•	Facilitate decision-making through actionable recommendations.
Power BI was selected for this project due to its:
•	Seamless importability of Excel datasets.
•	Strong DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculated measures.
•	Dense set of interactive visuals (bar charts, line charts, maps, cards, slicers).
•	Capacity to publish and share dashboards with stakeholders.
